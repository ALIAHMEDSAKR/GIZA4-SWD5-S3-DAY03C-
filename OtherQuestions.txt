2- What’s Enum data type, when is it used? And name three common built_in enums used 
frequently?  

An Enum (short for Enumeration) is a distinct value type that allows you to create a set of named constants.
 Instead of using "magic numbers" or strings to represent states,
  you use descriptive names that make your code much easier to read and maintain.

Under the hood, each name in an enum corresponds to an integral value (usually an int), starting from 0 by default.
When is an Enum used?
Enums are best used when a variable can only take one out of a small, fixed set of possible values.

Improving Readability: if (order.Status == OrderStatus.Shipped) is much clearer than if (order.Status == 3).

Type Safety: It prevents developers from passing invalid values (like a status of "99") to a method that only accepts specific categories.

State Machines: Perfect for tracking the current state of a process (e.g., Pending, Active, Suspended, Deleted).

Switch Statements: Enums work beautifully with switch expressions, ensuring you cover all possible cases.

3 Common Built-in Enums in .NET

1. System.DayOfWeek
Used to represent the days of the week. This is commonly used with DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek.

Values: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.

2. System.ConsoleColor
Used to change the foreground or background color of the text in a Console application.

Values: Red, Green, Blue, White, Cyan, etc.

3. System.Net.HttpStatusCode
Used in web development (Web APIs) to represent the standard HTTP response codes.

Values: OK (200), NotFound (404), InternalServerError (500), Unauthorized (401), etc.






3- what are scenarios to use  string Vs StringBuilder? 

choosing between string and StringBuilder usually comes down to one question: How many times are you planning to change the data?
Use string when you have a fixed value or very few modifications.
Fixed Data
Small Concatenations
Security & Thread Safety

2. When to use StringBuilder
Use StringBuilder when you are performing heavy manipulation in a loop or dealing with massive amounts of text.
Large Loops
Dynamic Document Generation
Memory Efficiency

5- what meant by user defined constructor and its role in initialization
User-Defined Constructor is a special method you write within a class to control how an object is created.

What is its Role in Initialization?
The primary role of a constructor is to ensure that an object is in a valid state the moment it is born.

Mandatory Data: You can force the creator of the object to provide essential information. For example, you can't have a "User" without a "Username."

Setting Defaults: You can assign initial values to fields that shouldn't be null (like initializing a List<T>).

Logic Execution: You can run startup logic, such as opening a database connection or calculating an initial value based on inputs. 


6- compare between Array and Linked List

System.Array (or List<T> which uses an array internally) 
and
LinkedList<T> are the two primary ways to store linear data, but they behave very differently in memory.

1. Physical Structure
Array: Stores elements in contiguous memory locations (side-by-side). If you have an array of 5 integers, they sit in one solid block of memory.

Linked List: Stores elements in nodes scattered across memory. Each node contains the data and a "pointer" (reference) to the next node in the sequence.
